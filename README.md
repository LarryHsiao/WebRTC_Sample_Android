WebRTC_Sample_Android
===

An sample project of WebRTC. 
Signal server in : https://github.com/LarryHsiao/WebRTC_sample_set
It can call/answer Android/Web client which using the signal server in the repository shows above.

Notice : This app will crash if any failure cause. I made it crash for more identify exceptions. (And because it is faster to finish the sample)
